# bikesharing
## Overview
the client wanted to see if a bikesharing model would work in a different city, we are analyzing data from the NYC Citi Bike Program.Data is used from "Citi Bike"in order to create a presentation to the investors.
## Results
Using tableau I created 7 different visulizations using the total number of trips, the types of users and the trip duration. Here's what we found:

* There was a total of 2,344,224 trips in the month of August.

* From the total trips 1,900,359 users subscribe to the company and 443,865 users are customers.

* The largest number of individuals happen to be male, the women users dont have as large of a peak and unkown users do not have a peak for tripduration.

* If you look at my trips per weekday(by hour) you can see that Thursday between 5pm-7pm is the most popular time to ride a bike.
* There is a peak number of users who rent their bike for 5-6 hour trips.
